<br />   
If you don't like application icons and want to only have files and folders on desktop (as shown in the picture), but still want to be able to launch applications in a convenient way, you can remove all the icons, and install [WOX](http://www.wox.one/) for quickly accessing applications.

Using MEGASync, you can synchronize your desktop among multiple devcies and access your documents anywhere with Internet connection.

###MEGASync
[MEGASync](https://mega.nz/) provides following functionalities:   
- secure cloud netdisk with 50GB free storage   
- fast transfers with end-to-end encryption   
- folder synchronization among multiple devices

As we can see, a very useful function of MEGASync is to synchronize folders among multiple devices. But it would become more interesting when we use it to put our desktop in the cloud.

### HOWTO

The configuration is very easy, just include the desktop directory for synchronization when setting up MEGASync.
